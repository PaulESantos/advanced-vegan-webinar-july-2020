## Donations

The webinar is free to attend; this is a difficult time for everyone, monies are tight, and options for training have been reduced because of Covid-19. However, if you are financially able, please consider making a donation to the University of Regina Student Emergency Fund, which helps provide urgently needed support to our hardworking students.

## Description

For community ecologists using R, one of the most-used, and useful, add-on packages is **vegan**, which provides a wide range of functionality covering inter alia ordination, diversity analysis, and ecological simulation. This workshop is envisioned as a follow-up to the [Introduction to vegan webinar](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/intro-vegan-webinar-july-2020) offered earlier this week or for those that already use vegan and want to delve into some of the detail.

The webinar will cover

* when and how to use multivariate methods including constrained ordination (CCA, RDA, Constrained PCoA), as well as between-group tests such as PERMANOVA;

* design- and model-based permutations and the exchangeability of samples in tests; and

* the use of vegan to go beyond simply fitting a constrained ordination model, to diagnostics, plotting, etc.

The webinar  assumes that participants have a basic level of familiarity with working in R, including data import and basic indexing and subsetting, with the use of basic functions in vegan, and with community ecology statistics, such as ordination. If you are new to vegan, consider watching the [Introduction to vegan webinar](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/intro-vegan-webinar-july-2020) from July 7th.

By registering for the webinar you'll get emails linking you to webinar and the webinar materials (slides etc). The webinar is free to attend and all materials will be freely accessible. Registering just allows me to gauge interest and to provide updates to you in the lead up to the webinar.

The webinar will be live streamed on YouTube owing to the number of people that have registered. The recording will be available after the webinar if the time in your time zone isn't convenient for you.
